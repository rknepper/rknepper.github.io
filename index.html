        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am a technical leader who solves the hardest problems in robotics
          and autonomy. My passion is to build robot systems that help people
          solve real problems in their lives. I am particularly drawn to
          systems-level problems because their solutions often require
          cross-functional knowledge, collaboration, and conï¬‚ict resolution. I
          thrive in high-ambiguity situations and especially enjoy the
          intersection of people and tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Leadership.</b> My leadership style emphasizes clear communication
          of a compelling vision to the teams in my charge and granting them
          the autonomy and inspiration to connect the overall vision to their
          own personal vision as it relates to their area of expertise. Workers
          who form and follow their own vision are intrinsically motivated to
          do their best, most creative work. Many of the highest-impact
          outcomes originate in the spark of an idea from an individual
          contributor. My role is to nourish that spark into a great flame.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Research.</b> I am an internationally-recognized intellectual
          leader in the robotics research community. I built top research and
          development teams in human-robot interaction (HRI) at two
          institutions. This topic is of crucial importance when delivering
          robot intelligence to everyday people; many people struggle to adapt
          to robots, so we must instead program robots to adapt to their users'
          needs. My expertise also extends to robot motion planning, motion
          control, and multi-robot algorithms. My research has led to a variety
          of awards and speaking invitations at conferences and universities
          around the world.
